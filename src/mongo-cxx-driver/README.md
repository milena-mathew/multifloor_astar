# MongoDB C++ Driver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver.svg?branch=26compat)](https://travis-ci.org/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver)

Welcome to the MongoDB C++ Driver!

This branch contains the `26compat` C++ driver.  Use this branch only if
you have existing code that used the 26compat driver and want it to
continue working without modification.

**NOTE: The 26compat driver has reached end-of-life status.  Its use is strongly discouraged.**

Switch to the "legacy" branch if you had previously been using 26compat (or
the driver inside of the server source) and want to benefit from
incremental improvements while having the same overall API.

Switch to the "master" branch if you are using MongoDB's C++ driver for the
first time.
